# Welcome to My Go Learning Repository!

This repository is intended to keep track of the files I create while learning Go. Each file will contain code related to a specific concept or topic in Go, and will be accompanied by comments explaining how the code works.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have Go installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/).

## Usage

Download the necessary folder to check or the entire repo, navigate to the correct folder.

Once done, run the command:

`go build -o ./builds/ <file_name>.go`

This should create an executable file inside a folder called builds.

You can then run the executable.


## Contributing

If you find any errors or have suggestions for improving the code, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
